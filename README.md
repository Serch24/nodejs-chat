# Chat with node.js and socket.io
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Serch24/nodejs-chat.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/Serch24/nodejs-chat)

This page was made with sass and nodejs. It is  an interative chat, using socket.io so if you write a message everyone in the chat would see it.

If your want to run it in local:

```git
git clone https://github.com/Serch24/nodejs-chat.git
```

```bash
cd nodejs-chat
```

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```
